# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification

This project implements and compares two deep learning models for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras.

## Dataset
Fashion MNIST consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28) across 10 fashion categories such as shirts, trousers, shoes, bags, coats, and dresses.

## Project Objectives
- Perform image preprocessing and normalization
- Train and evaluate two different deep learning models
- Compare performance between Dense Neural Network and CNN architectures
- Analyze feature learning improvements using convolutional layers

## Models Implemented
1. Dense Neural Network (Baseline Model)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Results / Output

### Dense Neural Network
- Test Accuracy: **89%**
- Successfully classified fashion objects using fully connected layers.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Test Accuracy: **90%**
- Improved performance through spatial feature extraction using convolution and pooling layers.
